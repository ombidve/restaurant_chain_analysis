# restaurant_chain_analysis
A restraurant chain wants to know the data insights about their outlets, customers, cuisins so that they can provide them better service and better offers.
Several adv. SQL queries are performed using CTE mostly to extract the required data.
Queries such as: 
Find Top 1 outlets by cuisine type without using limit and top
Find daily new customers count from launch date
Count all users aquired in Jan 2025 AND placed less than 3 orders in Jan, and then did not place order at all
List all customers with NO order in last 7 days but were aquired one month ago with their 1st order on promo code
Create a trigger for every 3rd order of customer
List customers who placed more than one order and all their orders had promo code
List customers who were aquired in Jan 2025 organically (custoomers aquired without any promo code)

Intermediate SQL learners can refer this project for their uderstanding. 
CTE is very simple guys, it makes solving SQL queries easy!
